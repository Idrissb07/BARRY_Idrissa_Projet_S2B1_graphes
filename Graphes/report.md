# Graph Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project was carried out as part of the graph theory course.
It aims to apply the concepts studied during the practical sessions.

## Work done
Several types of graphs were implemented:
- simple graph
- graph from adjacency matrix
- graph from adjacency list

For each graph, we computed:
- number of vertices
- number of edges
- average degree
- diameter
- regularity

## Conclusion
This project helped me better understand graph structures and their
manipulation using Python and NetworkX.
